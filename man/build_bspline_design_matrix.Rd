\title{Construct a B-spline Design Matrix}
\usage{
build_bspline_design_matrix(omega, knots, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{omega}{A numeric vector of input locations at which to evaluate the basis function.}

\item{knots}{A numeric vector of knots.}

\item{k}{The degree of the B-spline basis function (must be 0, 1, or 2).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with \code{length(omega)} rows and \code{length(knots) - k - 1} columns,
where each column is a normalised B-spline basis function evaluated at \code{omega}.
}
\description{
Builds the B-spline basis matrix by evaluating each normalised truncated power B-spline
basis function at the input locations \code{omega}. Each column of the matrix corresponds
to one basis function.
}
\details{
The number of basis functions is given by \code{length(knots) - k - 1}. Each column of the matrix
is computed using \code{\link{evaluate_bspline_basis}}.
}
\examples{
knots <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
omega <- seq(0, 5, length.out = 100)
B <- build_bspline_design_matrix(omega, knots, k = 1)
matplot(omega, B, type = "l", lty = 1, col = 1:ncol(B))
