\title{Alpha Coefficients for Truncated Power Expansion of B-spline Basis}
\usage{
bspline_alpha_rule(knots, i, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{knots}{A numeric vector of knots.}

\item{i}{An integer index indicating the position in the knot sequence for which to compute the coefficients.}

\item{k}{The degree of the B-spline basis function (must be 0, 1, or 2).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of coefficients \eqn{\alpha_j} for the truncated power expansion.
}
\description{
Computes the coefficients \eqn{\alpha_j} in the truncated power representation of a B-spline basis function
of degree \code{k}, valid for \code{k = 0, 1, 2}. These coefficients allow the basis function to be expressed as a
linear combination of truncated power functions over the relevant knot interval.
}
\details{
For:
\itemize{
\item \code{k = 0}, returns \eqn{(1, -1)} for the characteristic function over a single interval.
\item \code{k = 1}, returns a 3-vector corresponding to linear B-spline basis functions.
\item \code{k = 2}, returns a 4-vector for quadratic B-spline basis functions.
}
The function throws an error if any required knot difference is zero (i.e. repeated knots), or if \code{k > 2}.
}
\examples{
knots <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
bspline_alpha_rule(knots, i = 1, k = 1)
