\title{Inverse Fourier Transform of a B-spline Basis Function}
\usage{
inverse_fourier_truncated_power(knots, i, k, tau)
}
\arguments{
\item{knots}{A numeric vector of knots.}

\item{i}{An integer index indicating the position in the knot sequence for which to compute the coefficients.}

\item{k}{The degree of the B-spline basis function (must be 0, 1, or 2).}

\item{tau}{A numeric vector of frequencies at which to evaluate the inverse Fourier transform.}
}
\value{
A complex-valued vector of the same length as \code{tau}, giving the inverse Fourier transform
of the basis function evaluated at each frequency.
}
\description{
Computes the inverse Fourier transform of a B-spline basis function of degree \code{k},
indexed by \code{i}, using its truncated power expansion representation. This is used
to construct spectral representations of B-spline basis functions.
}
\examples{
knots <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
tau <- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 200)
rho <- inverse_fourier_truncated_power(knots, i = 1, k = 1, tau = tau)
plot(tau, Re(rho), type = "l", main = "Real part of Fourier transform")
