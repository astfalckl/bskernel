\title{Reconstruct the Autocovariance Function (ACF) from Spectral Coefficients}
\usage{
reconstruct_acf(c, knots, k, tau)
}
\arguments{
\item{c}{A numeric vector of spectral coefficients (length equals number of basis functions).}

\item{knots}{A numeric vector of knots.}

\item{k}{The degree of the B-spline basis function (must be 0, 1, or 2).}

\item{tau}{A numeric vector of frequencies at which to evaluate the inverse Fourier transform.}
}
\value{
A real-valued numeric vector of the same length as \code{tau}, representing the reconstructed autocovariance.
}
\description{
Given a set of spectral coefficients and a B-spline basis, this function reconstructs
the autocovariance function via inverse Fourier transform.
}
\details{
The function computes a weighted sum of inverse Fourier transforms of the B-spline basis functions.
The zero-lag autocovariance (at \code{tau[1]}) is manually set to the total spectral mass \code{sum(c)},
ensuring numerical consistency.
}
\examples{
knots <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
c <- c(1, 0.5, 0.2)
tau <- seq(0, 10, length.out = 200)
acf <- reconstruct_acf(c, knots, k = 1, tau = tau)
plot(tau, acf, type = "l")
